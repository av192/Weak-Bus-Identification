# Weak-Bus-Identification
The final project of - Apoorva Bhardwaj and Manjeet Rathore, IIT Dhanbad '24. Employed LSI and FVSI method to identify weak buses in IEEE 14 Bus and 30 Bus test system.

Run Working_NR.m to get the power flow and line flow solution, either by GS or NR method. Uses IEEE 14 Bus and IEEE 30 Bus data. Gives LSI and FVSI of each line present in the system.
